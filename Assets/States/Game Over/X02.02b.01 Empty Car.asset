  storyText: 'You stay in front of the doors to the empty car while other people
    shuffle to the sides.


    The doors open and you are hit by the foulest stench
    since... since... well, since your walk to the subway. That''s just how the city
    is.


    There''s no way you can stand with this stench in an enclosed space,
    though. You don''t understand how other people are on the car, but you see now
    that they have their coats drawn up past their faces. It''s too late to get into
    another car. You do not make it to work on time.


    Ending 3 of 10.


    Go
    back to the beginning?


    1. Yes.

    2. No.'
