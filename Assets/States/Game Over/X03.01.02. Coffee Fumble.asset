  storyText: 'Just as you thought, as you approach the subway gate you can hear the
    train approaching. Your hands are full from the shop and you fumble getting out
    your subway card at the gate. As you get through the gate you make a run for
    it but the doors close before you get there. You hold onto hope for a second
    because sometimes the doors open again as people block the doors. No luck today.


    You
    missed the train and will be late for work.


    Ending 4 of 10.
