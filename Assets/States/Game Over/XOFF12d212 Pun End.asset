  storyText: 'The clients look at each other, concerned. The silence induced by your
    cactus pun hangs in the air.


    The silence is broken by the sharp exhale
    of one of the clients. At the end of the table, now fully laughing, is a bald
    man who could pass as a Batman villian in the right costume.


    The rest of
    the table erupts in laughter. Alberta and Dr. Grove look pleased.


    "Sounds
    like we''re ready to change the world!" says the man.


    Ending 10 of 10.
