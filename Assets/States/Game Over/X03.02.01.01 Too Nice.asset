  storyText: 'You give way to the the elderly gentleman. You''ve made room for him
    on one side, but from the other side he gets broadsided by a woman in a peacoat
    and his gait is turned sideways. The throng consumes him and carries him onto
    the train. He doesn''t acknowledge you.


    The subway train can''t possibly
    fit another body. The doors close on your hopes of getting to work on time.
