  storyText: 'The people exiting have other plans and are more desperate than you.
    You are met head on by a small lady with a scarf wrapped up past her nose who
    pushes you back with the strength of a bull. The mass of people exiting carries
    you back out of the door and past the commuters waiting on the platform. Now
    behind the crowd, commuters flood the entrance and board the train.


    By
    the time you dislodge from your crowd surfing, there is no room left on the train.
    Your stomach growls and the doors close.


    You do not make it to work on
    time.


    Ending 6 of 10.

    1. Yes.

    2.
    No.'
