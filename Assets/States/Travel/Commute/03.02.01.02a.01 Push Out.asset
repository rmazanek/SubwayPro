  storyText: 'You place your arms into a "v" in front of you to act like a plow.


    While
    quietly saying "excuse me" to absolve yourself of all impoliteness, you make
    progress towards the doors. At the doorway several people who were waiting on
    the platform try to squeeze past you the opposite way, into the train. They look
    at you like you''ve done something wrong.


    You climb the stairs and exit
    the station. From here you only have a short walk to work.


    Your stomach
    growls.


    1. Continue.'
