  storyText: "Just before the doors open you scan the crowd and see that several
    people are getting ready to exit. This is a relief to you, as you didn't want
    to push your way out today. \n\nToday is your big meeting and don't want to go
    in sweaty. You were up late last night working... on a weekend!\n\nYou ride the
    coattails of these brave commuters (almost literally) to easily exit the train.\n\nYou
    climb the stairs and exit the station. From here you only have a short walk to
    work.\n\nYour stomach growls.\n\n1. Continue."
