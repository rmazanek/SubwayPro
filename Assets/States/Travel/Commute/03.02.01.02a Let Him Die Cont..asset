  storyText: 'The doors close and you settle into the armpit of someone reading a
    book. The person jammed in front of you is not quite facing you, but you are
    too close to focus on their entire face. You put in your headphones and try not
    to breathe directly onto their chin.


    Your stomach growls.


    After 15
    minutes of trying to hold that position through acceleration and deceleration,
    you get to your stop.


    You mentally prepare to exit the subway car.


    1.
    Push your way off saying quietly, "excuse me, excuse me" but not really meaning
    it.

    2. Hope another brave soul will blaze the path so you can follow in
    their wake.'
