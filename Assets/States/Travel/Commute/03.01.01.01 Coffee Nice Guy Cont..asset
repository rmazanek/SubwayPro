  storyText: 'The car is packed tight, but because you squeezed on just before the
    doors closed you are able to maintain your position near the doorway. Over the
    next few stops your position even shifts towards the side of the door so you''re
    not completely blocking the flow of passengers.


    At your stop you are able
    to easily exit the train, coffee intact. You climb the stairs and exit the station.
    From here it''s only a short walk.


    Your stomach growls.


    1. Continue.'
