  storyText: "You make it to the subway with plenty of time, but you're really hungry.
    \n\nAs the train approaches the station you can feel the anticipation of the
    growing mass of commuters behind you. You feel a little too close to the edge
    of the platform but you try not to think about that. \n\nThe train swoops in
    and is now slowing as it passes in front of you, replacing the darkness of the
    tracks below.\n\nThe doors open and a familiar chime indicates that people should
    exit the train.\n\nDo you step out of the way?\n\n1. Yes.\n2. Hell no. I'm getting
    on that train. They can go around me."
