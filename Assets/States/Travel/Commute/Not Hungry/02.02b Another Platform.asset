  storyText: 'There is a pack of people ahead of you here. The steel-colored train
    barrels in and every car that passes seems more full than the last... except
    for the car that lands in front of you. There are only a few people on board.


    Is
    today your lucky day? Several people in front of you move away from the basically
    empty train.


    1. Get on the train.

    2. Try to push into another car.'
