  storyText: 'You ignore the person asking for food and get to the subway platform
    with plenty of time.


    You lean against a pillar and start to eat your granola
    bar. As you do, you see the person from the entrance is now asking for food on
    the platform. You feel really guilty and decide to move farther down the platform.


    In
    doing so, you lose your position close to the train tracks.
