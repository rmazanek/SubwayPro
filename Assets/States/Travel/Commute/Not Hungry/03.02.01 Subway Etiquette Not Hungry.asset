  storyText: 'You slide to the side of the train, next to the open door, being careful
    to maintain your place in the disorderly queue.


    When the last passenger
    is making his way out, several people start rushing onto the train, squeezing
    the passenger in between them. The passenger is noticeably angry, but avoids
    getting dragged back onto the train.


    Now is your chance to get on the train.


    Out
    of the corner of your eye you notice an elderly man close to your shoulder.


    1.
    Try to let him through.

    2. I''m already ahead of him. I''m getting on the
    train.'
