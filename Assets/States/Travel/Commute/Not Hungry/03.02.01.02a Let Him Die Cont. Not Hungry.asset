  storyText: 'The doors close and you settle into the armpit of someone reading a
    book. The person jammed in front of you is not quite facing you, but you are
    too close to focus on their entire face. You put in your headphones and try not
    to breathe directly onto their chin.


    After 15 minutes of trying to hold
    that position through acceleration and deceleration, you get to your stop.


    You
    mentally prepare to exit the subway car.


    1. Push your way off saying quietly,
    "excuse me, excuse me" but not really meaning it.

    2. Hope another brave
    soul will blaze the path so you can follow in their wake.'
