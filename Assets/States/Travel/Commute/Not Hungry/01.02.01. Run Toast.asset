  storyText: 'You nearly trip running down the steps of the subway entrance, but
    you made it to the platform. You''re a little sweaty. You lean over the tracks
    and stare into the darkness of the subway tunnel and can just barely make out
    the train lights.


    You wait about a minute before the train screeches to
    a halt in front of you and the doors open.
