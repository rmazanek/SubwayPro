  storyText: 'You feel a small prick from the needle and a slight chill at the injection
    site.

    yelps and jumps off of you. The other henchmen move away, but their job is done.


    With
    blurring vision you get sight of your hand and in the dim light of the conference
    room you see that you no longer have fingers. Your hand is just a green stub
    with short fibrous needles scattered over the surface.


    1. Continue.'
