  storyText: 'The lights dim and the meeting opens with a short marketing video you''ve

    with some flash and buzzwords. The potential clients today have stated that they
    want their crops to require less water, like cacti, and you''ve been working
    on pretty mundane slides about water use statistics for cactus farms. Maybe Dr.
    Grove is here to show them the product offerings.
