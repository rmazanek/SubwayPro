  storyText: 'Once in the meeting room Alberta introduces you to a team sent by the
    potential client. You shake hands with everyone but notice that Boslo is not
    being his normally boisterous self. He''s being a little prickly.


    You don''t
    recognize someone in the room, but he is introduced to the clients as Dr. Grove.
    He is supposed to assist with the demonstration. You were not aware there would
    be a demonstration.


    Alberta starts to describe the meeting agenda when
    your stomach growls loudly. It interrupts her but she catches her train of thought.


    1.
    Continue.'
