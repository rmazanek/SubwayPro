  storyText: "Your neck has started to feel very sore.\n\nYou attempt to scratch
    your chin but your arm feels stiff and heavy. You struggle to lift your hand,
    and when your hand reaches your chin you feel a sharp prick. \n\nYou look down
    at your hand and in the dim light of the conference room you can see you no longer
    have fingers. Your hand is just a green stub with short fibrous needles scattered
    around the surface. You attempt to pull your hand away, but it will no longer
    move.\n\n1. Continue."
