  storyText: 'Milling about outside of the conference room you see several large
    men. They are wearing suit jackets with some strange angles and might be hiding
    things underneath. They witnessed the exchange with Alberta and are not concerned.


    You
    go to the bathroom to collect yourself. After a few minutes you go back to the
    meeting.


    Alberta and Dr. Grove look relieved when you get back.
