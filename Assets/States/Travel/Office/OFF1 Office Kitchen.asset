  storyText: 'On the kitchen counter is an open box of donuts with one donut left.


    "Weren''t
    these here yesterday?" You think to yourself. The box is from the donut shop
    down the street and is a pretty regular appearance in the office. I guess your
    coworkers got to them first.


    The donut doesn''t look appetizing, but your
    stomach is becoming a problem. How bad could it be?


    1. Eat the donut.

    2.
    Leave the donut.
