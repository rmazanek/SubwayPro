  storyText: 'Milling about outside of the conference room you see several large
    men, who seem surprised that the door opened. They are wearing suit jackets with
    some strange angles and might be hiding things underneath. After a brief pause
    they go back to their discussion.


    Your apartment keys are at your desk
    so you calmly gather them before walking to the bathroom to avoid suspicion.


    You
    avoid the conference room on your way to the elevators. As the elevator doors
    close you hear a set of heavy footsteps approach the lobby.


    You hear Alberta
    say, "Did you just let him leave? If he isn''t in the bathroom, find him and
    kill him."


    1. Continue.'
