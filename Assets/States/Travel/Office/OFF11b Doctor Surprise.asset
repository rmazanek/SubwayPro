  storyText: 'Once in the meeting room Alberta introduces you to a team sent by the
    potential client. Boslo is being his annoyingly boisterous self, but your dry
    mouth prevents you from introducing yourself to the first client. You clear your
    throat and manage a smile and a nod for the rest.


    You don''t recognize

    supposed to assist with the demonstration. You were not aware there would be
