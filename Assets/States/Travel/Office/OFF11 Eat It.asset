  storyText: "Oh that's a bit stale. \n\nYou have another bite just to be sure. Yes,
    it is stale. Come to think of it, today is Monday. These donuts are from Friday.
    \n\nYou toss the rest, hoping that no one has ever died from eating old donuts.\n\nTime
    for your meeting. On the way to the conference room you meet your coworker, Boslo.
    Your mouth begins to feel a little dry, but you try to smile and give him a quick
    wave.\n\n1. Continue."
